# RubiksCubeSolver
Project for CSC384 Artificial Intelligence at U of T

To execute our program type in:
python3 rubikscube.py

The program will then ask you: 
Would you like to enter your own cube? [y/q] (entering anything else will run premade test cases)

If you enter 'y', you can input your own string, and if you enter anything else it will execute the already
made test problems. Entering 'q' will result in exiting the program.
